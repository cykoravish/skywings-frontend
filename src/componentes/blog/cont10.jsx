To make sure candidates’ best experience we have to be responsive, continuous guidance, transparent process, and proper feedback. We often neglect candidates whose result is not positive. We are equally responsible to give them the feedback. It is not that if a candidate fails to crack interview at one place couldn’t crack anywhere else. Being transparent in giving feedback makes more sense.",

  txt6: "Role Rotation-" ,
  txt7: "Role rotation or switch is another feature in transforming employees into leaders. This would essentially mean that high potential employees should be exposed to a set of functions and not just one. What is expected of a leader is that he should be abreast of all the nuts and bolts of the company. He should hold a holistic view of the company and be able to examine the different facets of the business through his knowledge and understanding and therefore, it is important that employees of the organization are allowed exposure to all inter-linked functions.",

Hence, this should be properly planned and structured keeping the Vision of the company and most importantly the core business in range. So, if you are in the business of developing software for the hospitality industry, every person in the product team must feel responsible towards the design and the product getting developed. Focus cannot just shift away from the nucleus of the company and the culture should thoroughly imbibe it.",
